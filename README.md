## Hi there, I'm Shijie Peng ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student at the **University of Chinese Academy of Sciences** with my research training based at the **Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology**. Iâ€™ve since developed a strong interest in the intersection of **machine learning systems**, **cloud computing**, and **edge-cloud collaboration**. 

### ðŸš€ Current Research and Work
- **Machine Learning Systems**: Iâ€™m exploring ways to improve the efficiency and scalability of machine learning systems in real-world, high-demand environments.
- **Cloud-Edge Collaboration**: My primary focus is optimizing resource utilization across cloud and edge devices, especially in large-scale data centers where performance and efficiency are critical.
- **Resource Management**: Through my work, I aim to develop solutions that ensure high system performance while maintaining fault tolerance, balancing resource distribution, and optimizing overall infrastructure.

### ðŸŒ± Continuous Learning
Iâ€™m always eager to deepen my knowledge of **cloud-native architecture**, **serverless computing**, and **distributed systems**. Currently, Iâ€™m refining my expertise in **pipeline parallelism** for ML workloads, especially in the context of large language models.

### ðŸ’¡ Collaboration & Interests
- **Collaboration**: Iâ€™m excited to work with teams on projects that involve **distributed ML systems**, **edge-computing architectures**, and **fault-tolerant design**. 
- **Research Questions**: Iâ€™m interested in tackling complex challenges like optimizing **resource allocation** for dynamic workloads, enhancing **data processing pipelines** across cloud-edge environments, and innovating in **system robustness and fault tolerance**.
- Outside of research, youâ€™ll often find me outdoors, hiking trails.

### ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About
Iâ€™m well-versed in **Kubernetes**, **cloud infrastructure**, and **serverless frameworks**. I enjoy discussing efficient resource management strategies and exploring emerging trends in edge AI and ML-based system performance optimization.
